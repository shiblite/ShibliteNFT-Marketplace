# Introduction

Rarx is a multi-chain and cross-chain advanced NFT marketplace with features like AI NFT Generation, Cross-chain NFTs, On-chain NFT Collections, Realtime Notifications, Subscriptions for artists, and many other features at one place

# Technologies

We have integrated a lot of technologies to make our marketplace stand out and make it more useful. We started working on this project from a production perspective as we want to take our marketplace live and solve problems that existing NFT marketplaces have and simultaneously offer crazy and useful functionalities which will attract users to our marketplace.

1. Connext: we are using connext and NFTHashi for cross-chain NFTs. Connext makes the process of bridging NFTs very easy on our marketplace.
2. Polybase: This is the backbone of our marketplace, we are using polybase to store instances of users, NFTs, and collections when created on-chain. As it is a decentralized database with no downtime issues, we are fetching all the data from the polybase itself on our marketplace.
3. Push Protocol: we are using push protocol for real-time notifications, and chat between users is also handled by push chat. Push protocol respects the privacy of every chat as the messages are encrypted and stored on-chain.
4. UMA OO: we are using UMA's Optimistic Oracle to verify the NFT Collections.
5. Intmax: To provide a smooth user experience for the users who are using our marketplace on mobile phones and tablets we are using the Intmax wallet. Intmax wallet provides a lot of cool features like biometric verifications which eventually improve the UX of our marketplace.
6. Superfluid: We are using superfluid to back our membership subscriptions of artists.

# Chains

Also as our marketplace is a multi-chain marketplace, we have deployed it on 6 different chains :

1. Gnosis chain: Gnosis Chain is a highly decentralized EVM blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions, scalability, community, and sustainable growth.
2. Polygon chain: Polygon zkEVM is the first zero-knowledge scaling solution that is fully equivalent to an EVM.
3. Scroll chain: Scroll is a zero-knowledge roll-up built to scale Ethereum.
4. Filecoin chain: FVM brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy.
5. Taiko chain: Taiko enables developers and users to experience Ethereum securely, with lower transaction fees, and without needing to consider any changes.
6. Mantle chain: Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum layer-2 network built with modular architecture delivering low fees and high security.

# Future Plans

As we have mentioned earlier we are building this marketplace from a production perspective because we want to get our marketplace live in coming weeks.
Here are some upcoming feature we will be adding post hackathon :

1. DAO voting using UMA (OO) -
   Users can vote for which NFTs should appear on the home page of our ShibLite Marketplace, featuring NFTs on home page affects the sales of a particular collection and artist directly or indirectly. so let the platform users/dao members decide which NFTs should be on the home page
2. Push Group Chat -
   We want to add a group chat functionality in every NFT page, where users can discuss on topics related to that particular NFT or NFT collection.
3. Token Bridging -
   Users can bridge their tokens from one chain to another from our marketplace itself, we will be using connext xcalls for this functionality.

# Open Source Contributions

We are open for open source contributions once the ethglobal : scaling ethereum hackathon results are out we will enable open source contribution and also add the steps to run this github repo code in your localhost.
